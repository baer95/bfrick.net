Hey there, I am Bernhard Frick and I do stuff. Originally from Austria where I
studied Computer Science and used to go mountaineering every weekend, I now live
in Amsterdam and spend most of my free time volunteering for
[De Sering](https://desering.org/), a community kitchen and public space in
Amsterdam West. My involvement is mostly around maintenance of the physical
space (plumbing, electricity, painting, fixing broken equipment, etc.), and
hosting software to support daily operations (website, wiki, etc.). See
[Projects](projects.md#volunteering-de-sering) if you want to know more. My day
job is keeping [marktplaats.nl](https://www.marktplaats.nl/) up and running,
with my focus areas being relational databases and K8s.
